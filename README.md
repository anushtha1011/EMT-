#  ELECTRIC MOTOR TEMPERATURE DETECTION
##  Objective-
 This project aims to estimate temperature sequences inside Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors from given input sequences, that is, currents, voltages, coolant and ambient temperatures, and torque as well as motor speed. All sensor data is recorded on a testbench.

## Structure
The project folder named PMSM contains three folders within. 

'Data folder' containing dataset description, attributes of the dataset description, output images of graphs.

'Code Folder' containing jupyter notebooks that contains code for all the work done in project in order.

'Report' containing report file in pdf, source files for overleaf and link to the overleaf directory.

'Help file' which is a map to create the project from scratch defining all the steps in detail.
