#  ELECTRIC MOTOR TEMPERATURE DETECTION
##  Objective-
 This project aims to estimate temperature sequences inside Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors from given input sequences, that is, currents, voltages, coolant and ambient temperatures, and torque as well as motor speed. All sensor data is recorded on a testbench.

***Dataset is anonymized and incomplete in order to meet confidentiality obligations.***

## Structure
Data used can be downloaded using the mentioned link in the *README file in DATASET section* and dataset description can be found in *PMSM/data.*

Data formating and operational algorithms are done in the path *PMSM/Code* 

All the conclusive results will be made avavilble in *PMSM/output*.

A summarised project report can be found in *PMSM/report.*
