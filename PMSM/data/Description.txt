# ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTION:
•	ambient - Ambient temperature as measured by a thermal sensor located closely to the stator.

•	Coolant - Coolant temperature. The motor is water cooled. Measurement is taken at outflow.

•	u_d - Voltage d-component

•	u_q - Voltage q-component

•	motor_speed - Motor speed

•	torque - Torque induced by current.

•	i_d - Current d-component

•	i_q - Current q-component

•	pm - Permanent Magnet surface temperature representing the rotor temperature. This was measured with an 	infrared thermography unit.

•	stator_yoke - Stator yoke temperature measured with a thermal sensor.

•	stator_tooth - Stator tooth temperature measured with a thermal sensor.

•	stator_winding - Stator winding temperature measured with a thermal sensor.

•	profile_id - Each measurement session has a unique ID. Make sure not to try to estimate from one session onto the other as they are strongly independent.


# FILE NAMES:
Here, we have three python files which contain the code notebooks. These are:
1) 1-Preprocessing and Analysis.py 
	It is Exploratory Data Analysis which describes the visualization of the dataset and initial analysis done.

2) 2-Regression.py
	It describes the various Regression Algorithms which were performed on the dataset like Linear Regression, Principal Component regression and Polynomial Regression.

3) 3-Regularization.py
	It defines the regularization in the regression algorithms.
